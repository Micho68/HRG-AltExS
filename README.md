## Alternative expansion scheme
According to Refs. \cite{borsanyi2021lattice,borsanyi2022resummed}, a novel expansion scheme was proposed to overcome the limitations of the lattice Taylor expansion and enable calculations at higher values of chemical potential. This new approach demonstrates improved convergence, with $\hat{\mu}_B = \frac{\mu_B}{T}\sim 3.5$, compared to the previous Taylor expansion which yielded $\hat{\mu}_B\sim 2.5$. The alternative Expansion Scheme relates Susceptibilities $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$ as shown in the Identity below see Eq: (\ref{altexsID})

$$
    \chi_n(T) = \frac{\partial^n (P/T^4)}{\partial (\mu_B/T)^n}
$$
where Pressure, P is defined from Taylor expansion  

$\frac{P(T,\mu_B)}{T^4} = \sum_0^\infty{\frac{1}{2n!}\chi_{2n}(T,\mu_B = 0)\left(\frac{\mu_B}{T}\right)^{2n}} $
